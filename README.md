# my-portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of my work as a junior software developer. The idea to allow potential employers to view my work and see what I have done previously. I'm hoping to lend my skills towards app/website development or even bolster my current reporting skills.

I used HTML5, CSS, Javascript and PHP to develop the website.

## Features
1. Navigation
2. About me section
3. Enquiry 'call-to-action' button with popup

## How to View the Project

## Credits
- I'll input any sources that I used to help me with building the website here
